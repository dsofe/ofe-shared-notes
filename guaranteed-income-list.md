> "Payments to an initial cohort of 100 low-income mothers began in July 2021, with plans to give them $500 or $1,000 per month for three years. So far, the cash has helped these moms better afford rent, child care, food, and diapers. This month, the program accepted applications for a new cohort of 500 mothers."

> "TBP is a guaranteed income program in New York City, providing biweekly payments to new moms and pregnant people in Washington Heights, Inwood and Central Harlem. The initial cohort, which began in June 2021, consists of 100 mothers, roughly half of which are Black and half are Latinx. One in five are undocumented, and all of them have an average household income under $52,000 per year (the median household income level in their neighborhoods)."

> Artists in New York can now get paid $1,000 a month to create â€” no strings attached. The Empire State is rolling out a $125 million program called Creatives Rebuild New York, which is intended to give artists more freedom to focus on their work without the burden of financial uncertainty....  
> To be eligible for the money, artists must be able to demonstrate financial need. Ultimately, 2,400 people will be accepted into the program and receive the stipend. Another 300 artists will receive jobs with community organizations that pay $65,000 per year.
